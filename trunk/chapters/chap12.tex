\chapter{\PTC\ Structure and Libraries}
\label{cha:ptc.code}

This chapter discusses the \PTC's structure and code libraries.

\fxnote{Al: I think this chapter describes how the latest version of the folder currently called ptc\_2008\_8\_14 is set up: what is in the various inc and f90 files, etc.}
