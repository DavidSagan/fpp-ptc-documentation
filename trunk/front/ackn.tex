\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I must thank \'Etienne Forest. Not only is he
the author of \PTC---hence \emph{sine qua non}---he has also answered
innumerable questions over the years and helped me to understand both
the structure of \PTC\ and the motivation behind many of the decisions
that went into its design. Many of the examples in this manual are
based on code he provided.

Al Kemp, of Impact Technical Publications, helped with the overall
organisation and the initial draft. In addition, several of my
colleagues at Tech-X commented on various parts of this document:
George Bell, Andrey Sobol, and David Bruhwiler.

Very special thanks go to Desmond Barber, for his support,
encouragement, and detailed reviews of the manuscript. His keen ear
for the English language, broad knowledge of accelerator physics,
and consistent willingness to help have improved this document in
more ways than I can possibly note. I am deeply in debt to him.

Financial support for the writing of this document was provided in
part by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of
Nuclear Physics under SBIR Grant No.\,DE-FG02-06ER84508.
