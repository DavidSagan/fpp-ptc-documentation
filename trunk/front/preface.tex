\chapter{Note to the Reader}

This manual describes \'Etienne Forest's \PTC, a software library
of data structures and tools for both integrating and analysing the
orbital and spin motion of particles in modern accelerators and
storage rings. I believe that \PTC\ is an important contribution
that should be more widely known, understood, and used by the
accelerator physics community, hence my efforts here. I will
therefore greatly appreciate your reporting any difficulties you
have with this document---errors, inconsistencies, infelicities of
language, \etc---to
\href{mailto:dabell@txcorp.com}{\nolinkurl{dabell@txcorp.com}}.
