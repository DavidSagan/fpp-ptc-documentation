A group of these transformations is shown to be identical to a group of the canonical angular momentum preserving mappings.  These mappings and the circular modes are parametrized similar to the Courant-Snyder forms for the conventional uncoupled, or planar, case.  The planar-to-circular and reverse transformers (beam adapters) are introduced in terms of the circular and planar modes; their implementation on the basis of skew quadrupole blocks is described.  Various kinds of matching for beams, adapters and solenoids are considered.  Applications of the planar-to-circular, circular-to-planar and circular-to-circular transformers are discussed.  A range of applications includes round beams at the interaction region of circular colliders, flat beams for linear colliders, relativistic electron cooling, and ionization cooling.},

	Year = {2010},
	Abstract = {Integrable systems appeared in physics long ago at the onset of classical dynamics with examples being Kepler's and other famous problems. Unfortunately, the majority of nonlinear problems turned out to be nonintegrable. In accelerator terms, any 2D nonlinear nonintegrable mapping produces chaotic motion and a complex network of stable and unstable resonances. Nevertheless, in the proximity of an integrable system the full volume of such a chaotic network is small. Thus, the integrable nonlinear motion in accelerators has the potential to introduce a large betatron tune spread to suppress instabilities and to mitigate the effects of space charge and magnetic field errors. To create such an accelerator lattice, one has to find magnetic and electric field combinations leading to a stable integrable motion. This paper presents families of lattices with one invariant where bounded motion can be easily created in large volumes of the phase space. In addition, it presents three families of integrable nonlinear accelerator lattices, realizable with longitudinal-coordinate-dependent magnetic or electric fields with the stable nonlinear motion, which can be solved in terms of separable variables.},

	Abstract = {Quadrupole ion traps can be transformed into nonlinear traps with integrable motion by adding special electrostatic potentials. This can be done with both stationary potentials (electrostatic plus a uniform magnetic field) and with time-dependent electric potentials. These potentials are chosen such that the single particle Hamilton-Jacobi equations of motion are separable in some coordinate systems. The electrostatic potentials have several free adjustable parameters allowing for a quadrupole trap to be transformed into, for example, a double-well or a toroidal-well system. The particle motion remains regular, non-chaotic, integrable in quadratures, and stable for a wide range of parameters. We present two examples of how to realize such a system in case of a time-independent (the Penning trap) as well as a time-dependent (the Paul trap) configuration.}}

We also derive an analytical expression, which determines the bandwidth of the free-electron laser. We also discuss the limitation on the number of growing modes for the case of beam energy distributions with multiple peaks.},

	Volume = {69},
	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {A condition for improved dynamic aperture for nonlinear, alternating gradient transport systems is derived using Lie transform perturbation theory. The Lie transform perturbation method is used here to perform averaging over fast oscillations by canonically transforming to slowly oscillating variables. This is first demonstrated for a linear sinusoidal focusing system. This method is then employed to average the dynamics over a lattice period for a nonlinear focusing system, provided by the use of higher order poles such as sextupoles and octupoles along with alternate gradient quadrupoles. Unlike the traditional approach, the higher order focusing is not treated as a perturbation. The Lie transform method is particularly advantageous for such a system where the form of the Hamiltonian is complex. This is because the method exploits the property of canonical invariance of Poisson brackets so that the change of variables is accomplished by just replacing the old ones with the new. The analysis shows the existence of a condition in which the system is azimuthally symmetric in the transformed, slowly oscillating frame. Such a symmetry in the time averaged frame renders the system nearly integrable in the laboratory frame. This condition leads to reduced chaos and improved confinement when compared to a system that is not close to integrability. Numerical calculations of single-particle trajectories and phase space projections of the dynamic aperture performed for a lattice with quadrupoles and sextupoles confirm that this is indeed the case.},

	Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that transverse beam halos can be controlled by combining nonlinear focusing and collimation. The study relies on one-dimensional, constant focusing particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and a particle-core model. Beams with linear and nonlinear focusing are studied. Calculations with linear focusing confirm previous findings that the extent and density of the halo depend strongly upon the initial mismatch of the beam. Calculations with nonlinear focusing are used to study damping in the beam oscillations caused by the mismatch. Although the nonlinear force damps the beam oscillations, it is accompanied by emittance growth. This process is very rapid and happens within the first 2--3 envelope oscillations. After this, when the halo is collimated using a system of four collimators, further evolution of the beam shows that the halo is not regenerated. The elimination of the beam halo could allow either a smaller physical aperture for the transport system or it could allow a beam of higher current in a system with the same physical aperture. This advantage compensates for the loss of particles due to collimation.},

This adiabatic invariant is conserved to all orders in $\epsilon$, the slowness parameter, except for orbits that cross a separatrix.  The present work discusses the change of the adiabatic invariant during this crossing process through order $\epsilon$.  First, a calculation of the change of the adiabatic invariant is presented.  This calculation is general and, hence, encompasses previous results for specific cases.  The change in the adiabatic invariant is shown to depend on a maximum of five parameters, which are functions of the Hamiltonian of interest.  Second, the statistics of this process are derived.  Finally, these results are applied to the motion of a particle in a wave with changing amplitude and phase velocity.},

	Abstract = {The idealized mathematical problem of four bugs in cyclic pursuit starting from a 2-by-1 rectangle is considered, and asymptotic formulas are derived to describe the motion. In contrast to the famous case of four bugs on a square, here the trajectories quickly freeze to essentially one dimension. After the first rotation about the centre point, the scale of the configuration has shrunk by a factor of $10^{427907250}$, and this number is then exponentiated four more times with each successive cycle. Relations to Knuth's double-arrow notation and level-index arithmetic are discussed.},

From the viewpoint of polynomial approximation this seems necessary and indeed in certain respects optimal.  Nevertheless such methods may ``waste'' a factor of $\pi/2$ with respect to each space dimension.  We propose new nonpolynomial quadrature methods that avoid this effect by conformally mapping the usual ellipse of convergence to an infinite strip or another approximately straight-sided domain.  The new methods are compared with related ideas of Bakhvalov, Kosloff and Tal-Ezer, Rokhlin and Alpert, and others.  An advantage of the conformal mapping approach is that it leads to theorems guaranteeing geometric rates of convergence for analytic integrands.  For example, one of the formulas presented is proved to converge $50\%$ faster than Gauss quadrature for functions analytic in an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $[-1,1]$.},

One approach to the numerical quadrature of such integrals is to apply the trapezoid rule on a Hankel contour defined by a suitable change of variables. Optimal parameters for three classes of such contours have recently been derived: (a) parabolas, (b) hyperbolas, and (c) cotangent contours, following Talbot in 1979. The convergence rates for these optimized quadrature formulas are very fast: roughly $O(3^{-N})$, where $N$ is the number of sample points or function evaluations. On the other hand, convergence at a rate apparently about twice as fast, $O(9.28903^{-N})$, can be achieved by using a different approach: best supremum-norm rational approximants to $e^z$ for $z\elem(-\infty,0]$, following Cody, Meinardus and Varga in 1969. (All these rates are doubled in the case of self-adjoint operators or real integrands.) It is shown that the quadrature formulas can be interpreted as rational approximations and the rational approximations as quadrature formulas, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches are discussed in the light of these connections. A MATLAB function is provided for computing Cody-Meinardus-Varga approximants by the method of Carath{\'e}odory-Fej{\'e}r approximation.

Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of $\log((z+1)/(z-1))$ in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad{\'e} approximation at $z=\infty$. Clenshaw--Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at $z=\infty$ is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near $[-1,1]$.},

We present a 21st-century update of the Remez ideas in the context of the chebfun software system, which carries out numerical computing with functions rather than numbers. A crucial feature of the new method is its use of chebfun global rootfinding to locate extrema at each iterative step, based on a recursive algorithm combining ideas of Specht, Good, Boyd, and Battles. Another important feature is the use of the barycentric interpolation formula to represent the trial polynomials, which points the way to generalizations for rational approximations. We comment on available software for minimax approximation and its scientific context, arguing that its greatest importance these days is probably for fundamental studies rather than applications.},

If $f_{k,0} is the prescribed value of a function at the grid point $z_k$, and $f_{k,r}$ the prescribed value of the $r^\text{th}$ derivative, for $1 \leq r \leq n_k-1$, the Hermite interpolant is the unique polynomial of degree $N-1$ ($N = n_1 + \dotsb + n_K$) which interpolates the prescribed function values and function derivatives. We obtain another derivation of a method for Hermite interpolation recently proposed by Butcher et al. [\emph{Numerical Algorithms, vol.~56 (2011), p. 319-347}]. One advantage of our derivation is that it leads to an efficient method for updating the barycentric weights. If an additional derivative is prescribed at one of the interpolation points, we show how to update the barycentric coefficients using only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations. Even in the context of confluent Newton series, a comparably efficient and general method to update the coefficients appears not to be known. If the method is properly implemented, it computes the barycentric weights with fewer operations than other methods and has very good numerical stability even when derivatives of high order are involved. We give a partial explanation of its numerical stability.

When $n=2m$, we obtain $X_{2m,\nu}$ with less than half the number of square roots that are required to find the other Chebyshev points $X'_{2m,\nu}=\cos[(2\nu-1)\pi/2^{m+1}]$, $\nu=1(1)2^m$. Also, the barycentric interpolation formula may be applied to the solution of a near-minimax problem so as to avoid extensive calculation of auxiliary polynomials, and in a numerical differentiation procedure that conveniently by-passes direct differentiation of the interpolation polynomial.},

	Title = {Discrete Exterior Calculus},
	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {We present a theory and applications of discrete exterior calculus on simplicial complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. This can be thought of as calculus on a discrete space. Our theory includes not only discrete differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits both vector fields and forms.}}

The known expressions for the field inside and outside a uniformly charged ellipse are recovered in simple, concise form. Similarly, the expression for the field of a Gaussian distribution is found in a straightforward way as a special case of the more general formula.

When the pole boundaries are curved or an effective curvature is caused by the proximity of pole-piece corners, there are further first-order effects on the trajectories.  These effects can be minimized, and in practice made negligible, by correct centering of the beam relative to the pole-piece corners at entrance and exit.},

Our starting point is the 6D Lorentz system, which allows planar motions, and we examine this dynamical system as the wavelength of the traveling wave varies. By scalings and transformations the 6D system is reduced, without approximation, to a 2D system in a form for a rigorous asymptotic analysis using the Method of Averaging (MoA), a long time perturbation theory. The two dependent variables are a scaled energy deviation and a generalization of the so-called ponderomotive phase. As the wavelength varies the system passes through resonant and nonresonant (NR) zones and we develop NR and near-to-resonant (NtoR) normal form approximations. For a special initial condition and on resonance, the NtoR normal form reduces to the well-known FEL pendulum system. We then state and prove NR and NtoR first-order averaging theorems which give near optimal error bounds for the MoA approximations. The proofs are novel in that they do not use a near identity transformation and they use a system of differential inequalities. The NR case is an example of quasiperiodic averaging where the small divisor problem enters in the simplest possible way. To our knowledge the planar problem has not been analyzed with the generality we aspire to here nor has the standard FEL pendulum system been derived with associated error bounds as we do here.}}

Four major theorems are presented, one which ties invariant fields with the notion of normal form, one which allows one to compare different invariant fields, and two that relate the existence of invariant fields to the existence of certain invariant sets and relations between them. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles and their density matrices describing statistically the particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach thus unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the spin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach relates the examples elegantly and uncovers relations between the various underlying dynamical systems in a transparent way.}}

	Title = {A detailed and unified treatment of spin-orbit systems using tools distilled from the theory of bundles},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {We return to our study \cite{BEH} of invariant spin fields and spin tunes for polarized beams in storage rings but in contrast to the continuous-time treatment in \cite{BEH}, we now employ a discrete-time formalism, beginning with the Poincar{\'e} maps of the continuous time formalism. We then substantially extend our toolset and generalize the notions of invariant spin field and invariant frame field. We revisit some old theorems and prove several theorems believed to be new. In particular we study two transformation rules, one of them known and the other new, where the former turns out to be an SO(3)-gauge transformation rule. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of spin-1/2 and spin-1 particle bunches and their density matrix functions, describing semiclassically the particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach thus unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the spin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach relates the examples elegantly and uncovers relations between the various underlying dynamical systems in a transparent way. As in \cite{BEH}, the particle motion is integrable but we now allow for nonlinear particle motion on each torus. Since this work is inspired by notions from the theory of bundles, we also provide insight into the underlying bundle-theoretic aspects of the well-established concepts of invariant spin field, spin tune and invariant frame field. Since we neglect, as is usual, the Stern-Gerlach force, the underlying principal bundle is of product formso that we can present the theory in a fashion which does not use bundle theory. Nevertheless we occasionally mention the bundle-theoretic meaningof our concepts and we also mention the similarities with the geometrical approach to Yang-Mills Theory.}}

	Abstract = {A proposal to add 60-GeV electron and positron beams to the LHC at CERN (LHeC) is currently being prepared. The provision of electron and positron longitudinal polarisation is an important component of the proposal and we are examining the feasibility of Sokolov-Ternov self-polarisation at energies up to 60 GeV in a storage ring in the LHC tunnel. But at this energy the attainable polarisation can be very strongly limited by depolarising effects. This paper summarises first calculations of the attainable polarisation including estimates of the efficacy of Siberian Snakes for weakening synchrotron sideband resonances.},

In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, particles circulate at the injection energy, when multipole errors are most significant, for more than $10^7$ turns, but systematic tracking studies are limited to a small fraction of this total time---even on modern computers.  A considerable speedup is expected by replacing element-by-element tracking with the use of a symplectified one-turn map.  We have applied this method to the realistic LHC lattice, version 6, and report here our results for various map orders, with special emphasis on precision and speed.},

We have implemented orbital integrators based on drift-kick, bend-kick, and matrix-kick splits. On top of the orbital integrators, we have implemented various integrators for the spin motion. These integrators use quaternions and Romberg quadratures to accelerate both the computation and the convergence of spin rotations. We evaluate their performance and accuracy in quantitative detail for individual elements as well as for the entire RHIC lattice.

For the time being we will restrict ourselves to stochastic fluctuations which are not phase-space dependent. These results, within the context of the Fokker-Planck approximation, are a near complete extension of the Chao synchrotron integral formalism to nonlinear systems. Our results will depend on an ergodic theorem analogous to the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem.

We show that the averaged Fokker-Planck equation can be put into a simpler form consistent with a reduced dimensionality by one half. Our proof depends on a simple lemma, which amongst other things, is closely connected to the fact that the divergence of the phase space velocity is zero in each individual canonical plane. We also derive in one degree of freedom an expression for the quantum lifetime which is valid if the aperture is located in a region which is approximately integrable, i.e., foliated by KAM curves centred around the origin.}}

It simply uses the fact that if one has a partial Taylor inverter at one's disposal, then the four-dimensional phase space can be inverted at one monitor using monitors from a known section of the lattice, i.e., monitors as close to each other as possible. It should be pointed out that this theory can be modified to use up-stream or down-stream BPMs. The theory here uses up-stream BPMs. This is important in the analysis of a mysterious element, for example a strong wiggler, to be able to do both can give us a knowledge of the mysterious element.

In the second part of the part of the paper, we remind the reader that quadratic beam envelopes are dual to quadratic Lie operators and thus we can also compute lattice functions from the reconstructed BPM phase space.

Finally the method is applied to (pre-earthquake) experimental data from J-PARC which used 177 beam position monitors (BPMs). Each monitor recorded data in the horizontal and vertical planes.}}

	Title = {Equilibrium beam distribution in an electron storage ring near linear synchrobetatron coupling resonances},
	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {Linear dynamics in a storage ring can be described by the one-turn map matrix.  In the case of a resonance where two of the eigenvalues of this matrix are degenerate, a coupling perturbation causes a mixing of the uncoupled eigenvectors.  A perturbation formalism is developed to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one-turn map near such a linear resonance.  Damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation can be obtained by integrating their effects over one turn, and the coupled eigenvectors can be used to find the coupled damping and diffusion coefficients.  Expressions for the coupled equilibrium emittances and beam distribution moments are then derived.  In addition to the conventional instabilities at the sum, integer, and half-integer resonances, it is found that the coupling can cause an instability through antidamping near a sum resonance even when the symplectic dynamics are stable.  As one application of this formalism, the case of linear synchrobetatron coupling is analyzed where the coupling is caused by dispersion in the rf cavity, or by a crab cavity.  Explicit closed-form expressions for the sum/difference resonances are given along with the integer/half-integer resonances.  The integer and half-integer resonances caused by coupling require particular care.  We find an example of this with the case of a crab cavity for the integer resonance of the synchrotron tune.  Whether or not there is an instability is determined by the value of the horizontal betatron tune, a unique feature of these coupling-caused integer or half-integer resonances.  Finally, the coupled damping and diffusion coefficients along with the equilibrium invariants and projected emittances are plotted as a function of the betatron and synchrotron tunes for an example storage ring based on PEP-II.},

For coupled beam lines, a variety of approaches are possible for describing the linear optics; here, we propose an approach and notation that naturally generalizes the familiar Twiss parameters to the coupled case in 3 degrees of freedom. Our approach is based on an eigensystem analysis of the matrix of second-order beam moments, or alternatively (in the case of a storage ring) on an eigensystem analysis of the linear single-turn map. The lattice functions that emerge from this approach have an interpretation that is conceptually very simple: in particular, the lattice functions directly relate the beam distribution in phase-space to the invariant emittances. To emphasize the physical significance of the coupled lattice functions, we develop the theory from first principles, using only the assumption of linear symplectic transport. We also give some examples of the application of this approach, demonstrating its advantages of conceptual and notational simplicity.},

We revisit previous work done on this problem and follow Or's mathematical model [\textit{SIAM J.\ Appl.\ Math.}, \textbf{54} (1994), pp. 597--609].  A linear analysis of the equations of motion reveals that only the equilibrium points correspond to the inverted and noninverted states of the tippe top and that the modified Maxwell--Bloch equations describe the linear/spectral stability of these equilibria.  We supply explicit criteria for the spectral stability of these states.  A nonlinear global analysis based on energetics yields explicit criteria for the existence of a heteroclinic connection between the noninverted and inverted states of the tippe top.  This criteria for the existence of a heteroclinic connection turns out to agree with the criteria for spectral stability of the inverted and noninverted states.  Throughout the work we support the analysis with numerical evidence and include simulations to illustrate the nonlinear dynamics of the tippe top.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a continuous and discrete Lagrangian theory for stochastic Hamiltonian systems on manifolds, akin to the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck theory of Brownian motion in a force field.  The main result is to derive governing SDEs for such systems from a critical point of a stochastic action.  Using this result, the paper derives Langevin-type equations for constrained mechanical systems and implements a stochastic analogue of Lagrangian reduction.  These are easy consequences of the fact that the stochastic action is intrinsically defined.  Stochastic variational integrators (SVIs) are developed using a discrete variational principle.  The paper shows that the discrete flow of an SVI is almost surely symplectic and in the presence of symmetry almost surely momentum-map preserving.  A first-order mean-squared convergent SVI for mechanical systems on Lie groups is introduced.  As an application of the theory, SVIs are exhibited for multiple, randomly forced and torqued rigid bodies interacting via a potential.},

	Abstract = {A variant of the filter-diagonalization method, using targeted excitation to filter out unwanted modes, can extract exactly or nearly degenerate eigenmodes and frequencies from time-domain simulations.  Excitation provides a particularly simple way to produce filtered states with already-existing time-domain simulations, while requiring minimal storage space.  Moreover, using broader excitations that cover the entire range of desired frequencies requires just one-fifth as much computation as using narrow excitations.  With this method, almost any time-domain code can be easily turned into an efficient eigenmode solver with little or no change to the code.  To distinguish $M$ degenerate modes requires running at least $M$ different simulations, so the computational effort is proportional to the size of the degeneracy, no matter how closely-spaced the modes; however, from those $M$ simulations many other non-degenerate modes can also be extracted with high accuracy, without much extra effort.  This method allows relatively simple FDTD algorithms to compete with frequency-domain solvers, offering advantages of simplicity, flexibility and ease of implementation; also, it scales to very large problems and massively parallel computation, and it can be used to extract high-frequency modes without first having to identify lower-frequency modes.  The accuracy of this method is demonstrated by finding eigenmodes and frequencies of an electromagnetic resonant cavity.}}

The discrete equations share similarities to the continuous equations by preserving invariants, including the symplectic form and the momentum map.  We first present a formulation of discrete mechanics along with a discrete variational principle.  We then show that the resulting equations of motion preserve the symplectic form and that this formulation of mechanics leads to conservation laws from a discrete version of Noether's theorem.  We then use the discrete mechanics formulation to develop a procedure for constructing symplectic-momentum mechanical integrators for Lagrangian systems with holonomic constraints.  We apply the construction procedure to the rigid body and the double spherical pendulum to demonstrate numerical properties of the integrators.}}

	Title = {Bounds on the Maximum Attainable Equilibrium Polarization of Protons at High Energy in HERA},
	Year = {2000},
	Abstract = {For some years HERA has been supplying longitudinally spin polarised electron and positron ($e^\pm$) beams to the HERMES experiment and in the future longitudinal polarisation will be supplied to the H1 and ZEUS experiments.  As a result there has been a development of interest in complementing the polarised $e^\pm$ beams with polarised protons.  In contrast to the case of $e^\pm$ where spin flip due to synchrotron radiation in the main bending dipoles leads to self polarisation owing to an up-down asymmetry in the spin flip rates (Sokolov-Ternov effect), there is no convincing self polarisation mechanism for protons at high energy.  Therefore protons must be polarised almost at rest in a source and then accelerated to the working energy.

At HERA, if no special measures are adopted, this means that the spins must cross several thousand ``spin-orbit resonances''.  Resonance crossing can lead to loss of polarisation and at high energy such effects are potentially strong since spin precession is very pronounced in the very large magnetic fields needed to contain the proton beam in HERA-\emph{p}.  Moreover simple models which have been successfully used to describe spin motion at low and medium energies are no longer adequate.  Instead, careful numerical spin-orbit tracking simulations are needed and a new, mathematically rigorous look at the theoretical concepts is required.

This thesis describes the underlying theoretical concepts, the computational tools (SPRINT) and the results of such a study.  In particular strong emphasis is put on the concept of the invariant spin field and its non-perturbative construction.  The invariant spin field is then used to define the amplitude dependent spin tune and to obtain numerical non-perturbative estimates of the latter.  By means of these two key concepts the nature of higher order resonances in the presence of snakes is clarified and their impact on the beam polarisation is analysed.  We then go on to discuss the special aspects of the HERA-\emph{p} ring and measures for minimising the perturbations to the spin motion ($\rightarrow$ depolarisation) and thereby obtain first upper bounds on the permissible beam emittances needed to maintain polarisation up to high energy in HERA-\emph{p}.}}

The transport elements of the carbon/proton gantry are presently made of standard conducting dipoles.  Because of their large weight, of the order of $\sim100$\,tons, the total weight of the gantry with support structure is $\sim600$\,tons.  The novel gantry design that is described here is made of fixed field superconducting magnets, thus dramatically reducing magnet size and weight compared to conventional magnets.  In addition, the magnetic field is constant throughout the whole energy region required for tumor treatment.  Particles make very small orbit offsets, passing through the beam line.  The beam line is built of combined-function dipoles such as a nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient (NS-FFAG) structure.  The very large momentum acceptance NS-FFAG comes from very strong focusing and very small dispersion.  The NS-FFAG small magnets almost completely filled the beam line.  They first make a quarter (or close to a quarter) of an arc bending upward and an additional half of a circle beam line finishing so that the beam is pointed towards the patient.  At the end of the gantry, additional magnets with a fast response are required to allow radial scanning and to provide the required position and spot size.  The fixed field combined-function magnets for the carbon gantry could be made of superconducting magnets by using low temperature superconducting cable or by using high temperature superconductors.},

If the relative variation of the field with polar angle is of the order of the ratio of the velocity of the ion to the velocity of light, this focusing effect will compensate the defocusing effect of Bethe and Rose. It is shown further that if this variation has period $\pi/2$, a family of stable periodic orbits exists which are nearly concentric circles. The second order effects due to the simultaneous action of the variations with polar angle of the magnetic field and the accelerating electric field will be considered in a second paper.},

Two important types of magnetic field patterns are described, the radial-sector and spiral-sector patterns, the former being easier to understand and simpler to construct, the latter resulting in a much smaller accelerator for a given energy.  A theory of orbits in fixed-field alternating-gradient accelerators has been worked out in linear approximation, which yields approximate general relationships between machine parameters, as well as more accurate formulas which can be used for design purposes.  There are promising applications of these principles to the design of fixed-field synchrotrons, betatrons, and high-energy cyclotrons.}}

Included among these were the invention of fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerators and spiral sector cyclotrons, an extensive analysis of rf acceleration with particular attention to the consequences of Liouville's theorem, beam stacking, analytic and computational studies of nonlinear orbit theory, studies of collective instabilities, and the first demonstration of practical ways to achieve colliding beams.  Although no large FFAG accelerators were ever built, model FFAG accelerators turned out to be excellent devices for the experimental study of accelerator problems because they separate the guide field from the acceleration process.  Models were used to study nonlinear resonances, acceleration processes, space charge limits, and beam stacking.  Among the last MURA projects was an electron storage ring that became the first machine dedicated exclusively to the production of synchrotron radiation for experiments, a facility which evolved into the highly successful Synchrotron Radiation Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.}}

It is only recently that this construction has been generalized to the simplest noncompact group $SU(1,1)=Sp(2,R)=SL(2,R)$, the double cover of $SO(2,1)$.  The present work develops a theory of turns for $SL(2,C)$, the double and universal cover of $SO(3,1)$ and $SO(3,C)$, rendering a geometric representation in the spirit of Hamilton available for all low dimensional semisimple Lie groups of interest in physics.  The geometric construction is illustrated through application to polar decomposition, and to the composition of Lorentz boosts and the resulting Wigner or Thomas rotation.},

	Title = {On the Classical Radiation of Accelerated Electrons},
	Volume = {75},
	Year = {1949},
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the properties of the radiation from a high energy accelerated electron, as recently observed in the General Electric synchrotron.  An elementary derivation of the total rate of radiation is first presented, based on Larmor's formula for a slowly moving electron, and arguments of relativistic invariance.  We then construct an expression for the instantaneous power radiated by an electron moving along an arbitrary, prescribed path.  By casting this result into various forms, one obtains the angular distribution, the spectral distribution, or the combined angular and spectral distributions of the radiation.  The method is based on an examination of the rate at which the electron irreversibly transfers energy to the electromagnetic field, as determined by half the difference of retarded and advanced electric field intensities.  Formulas are obtained for an arbitrary charge-current distribution and then specialized to a point charge.  The total radiated power and its angular distribution are obtained for an arbitrary trajectory.  It is found that the direction of motion is a strongly preferred direction of emission at high energies.  The spectral distribution of the radiation depends upon the detailed motion over a time interval large compared to the period of the radiation.  However, the narrow cone of radiation generated by an energetic electron indicates that only a small part of the trajectory is effective in producing radiation observed in a given direction, which also implies that very high frequencies are emitted.  Accordingly, we evaluate the spectral and angular distributions of the high frequency radiation by an energetic electron, in their dependence upon the parameters characterizing the instantaneous orbit.  The average spectral distribution, as observed in the synchrotron measurements, is obtained by averaging the electron energy over an acceleration cycle.  The entire spectrum emitted by an electron moving with constant speed in a circular path is also discussed.  Finally, it is observed that quantum effects will modify the classical results here obtained only at extraordinarily large energies.}}

	Abstract = {For many damped-accelerating cavities for high-intensity beams, classifications of eigenmodes according to azimuthal indices are generally insufficient due to a lack of their axial symmetry.  To classify the eigenmodes in such cavities having general symmetry, the application of group theory is studied.  By taking basis functions from a complete set of eigenmodes, one can form a representation of the symmetry group of the cavity.  The eigenmodes can then be classified according to irreducible representations of the symmetry group.  This method is particularly useful for classifying the eigenmodes in complicated cavities, and for understanding the effects of perturbations on the eigenmodes.}}

	Title = {Transverse Spaced-Charge Effects in Circular Accelerators},
	Year = {1968},
	Abstract = {The particles in an accelerator interact with one another by electromagnetic forces and are held together by external focusing forces.  Such a many-body system has a large number of transverse modes of oscillation (plasma oscillations) that can be excited at characteristic frequencies by errors in the external guide field.

In Part I we examine one mode of oscillation in detail, namely the quadrupole mode that is excited in uniformly charged beams by gradient errors.  We derive self-consistent equations of motion for the beam envelope and solve these equations for the case in which the space-charge force is much less than the external focusing force, i.e., for strong-focusing synchrotrons.  We find that the resonance intensity is shifted from the value predicted by the usual transverse incoherent space-charge limit; moreover, because the space-charge force depends on the shape and size of the beam, the beam growth in always limited.  For gradient errors of the magnitude normally present in strong-focusing synchrotrons, the increase in beam size is small provided the beam parameters are properly chosen; otherwise the growth may be large.  Thus gradient errors need not impose a limit on the number of particles that can be accelerated. 

In Part II we examine the other modes of collective oscillation that are excited by machine imperfections.  For simplicity we consider only one-dimensional beams that are confined by harmonic potentials, and only small-amplitude oscillations.  The linearized Vlasov and Poisson equations are used to find the twofold infinity of normal modes and eigenfrequencies for the stationary distribution that has uniform charge density in real space.  In practice, only the low-order modes (the dipole, quadrupole, sextupole, and one or two additional modes) will be serious, and the resonant conditions for these modes are located on a tune diagram.  These results, which are valid for all beam intensities, are compared with the known eigenfrequencies for the stationary distribution that has uniform particle density in phase space, and are extrapolated to the Gaussian distribution observed in the Brookhaven AGS.}}

In fact, the K-V equations are not restricted to uniformly charged beams, but are equally valid for any charge distribution with elliptical symmetry, provided the beam boundary and emittance are defined by rms (root-mean-square) values.  This results because (i) the second moments of any particle distribution depend only on the linear part of the force (determined by least squares method), while (ii) this linear part of the force in turn depends only on the second moments of the distribution.  This is also true in practice for three-dimensional bunched beams with ellipsoidal symmetry, and allows the formulation of envelope equations that include the effect of space charge on bunch length and energy spread.  The utility of this rms approach was first demonstrated by Lapostolle for stationary distributions.  Subsequently, Gluckstern proved that the rms version of the K-V equations remain valid for all continuous beams with axial symmetry.  In this report these results are extended to continuous beams with elliptical symmetry as well as to bunched beams with ellipsoidal form, and also to one-dimensional motion.}}

A stability criterion analogous to the Keil-Schnell criterion for coasting beams is given which includes the effect of a beam interacting with perfectly conducting walls, resistive walls, and resonant structures.  Some examples for the CERN accelerators are included.}}

Attempts to explain this as a high-frequency coasting-beam instability require $e$-folding rates faster than a synchrotron period, and wavelengths shorter than a bunch length.  In this case, the usual Keil-Schnell coasting-beam criterion is used, but with local values of bunch current and momentum spread, as suggested by Boussard.  This yields $|Z/n|\approx13\Omega$ for the ISR, and values about five to ten times larger for the PS.  The restricitons mentioned above, however, are not fulfilled near threshold, or for frequencies as low as 100\,MHz.}}

In fact, we prove the stronger statement that the exponential bifurcation locus is connected in $\mathbb{C}$, an analog of Douady and Hubbard's celebrated theorem that the Mandelbrot set is connected. We show furthermore that $\infty$ is not accessible through any nonhyperbolic (``queer'') stable component. The main part of the argument consists of demonstrating a general ``Squeezing Lemma'', which controls the structure of parameter space near infinity. We also prove a second conjecture of Eremenko and Lyubich concerning bifurcation trees of hyperbolic components.},

In this paper the symplecticity of numerical integrators is investigated for constrained Hamiltonian systems with holonomic constraints.  The following two results will be derived. (i) It is shown that any first- or second-order symplectic integrator for unconstrained problems can be generalized to constrained systems such that the resulting scheme is symplectic and preserves the constraints.  Based on this, higher-order methods can be derived by the same composition methods used for unconstrained problems.  (ii) Leimkuhler and Reich [\textit{Math.\ Comp.}, \textbf{63} (1994), pp.\,589--605] derived symplectic integrators based on Dirac's reformulation of the constrained problem as an unconstrained Hamiltonian system.  However, although the unconstrained reformulation can be handled by direct application of any symplectic implicit Runge--Kutta method, the resulting schemes do not preserve the constraints.  In this paper it is shown that these schemes can be modified such that they also preserve the constraints.},

	Abstract = {Backward error analysis has become an important tool for understanding the long time behavior of numerical integration methods.  This is true in particular for the integration of Hamiltonian systems where backward error analysis can be used to show that a symplectic method will conserve energy over exponentially long periods of time.  Such results are typically based on two aspects of backward error analysis: (i) It can be shown that the modified vector fields have some qualitative properties which they share with the given problem and (ii) an estimate is given for the difference between the best interpolating vector field and the numerical method.  These aspects have been investigated recently, for example, by Benettin and Giorgilli in [\textit{J.\ Statist.\ Phys.}, \textbf{74} (1994), pp.\,1117--1143], by Hairer in [\textit{Ann.\ Numer.\ Math.}, \textbf{1} (1994), pp.\,107--132], and by Hairer and Lubich in [\textit{Numer.\ Math.}, \textbf{76} (1997), pp.\,441--462].  In this paper we aim at providing a unifying framework and a simplification of the existing results and corresponding proofs.  Our approach to backward error analysis is based on a simple recursive definition of the modified vector fields that does not require explicit Taylor series expansion of the numerical method and the corresponding flow maps as in the above-cited works.  As an application we discuss the long time integration of chaotic Hamiltonian systems and the approximation of time averages along numerically computed trajectories.},

	Abstract = {The grazing function $g$ is introduced---a synchrobetatron optical quantity that is analogous (and closely connected) to the Twiss and dispersion functions $\beta$, $\alpha$, $\eta$, and $\eta'$. It parametrizes the rate of change of total angle with respect to synchrotron amplitude for grazing particles, which just touch the surface of an aperture when their synchrotron and betatron oscillations are simultaneously (in time) at their extreme displacements. The grazing function can be important at collimators with limited acceptance angles. For example, it is important in both modes of crystal collimation operation---in channeling and in volume reflection. The grazing function is independent of the collimator type---crystal or amorphous---but can depend strongly on its azimuthal location. The rigorous synchrobetatron condition $g=0$ is solved, by invoking the close connection between the grazing function and the slope of the normalized dispersion. Propagation of the grazing function is described, through drifts, dipoles, and quadrupoles. Analytic expressions are developed for $g$ in perfectly matched periodic FODO cells, and in the presence of $\beta$ or $\eta$ error waves. These analytic approximations are shown to be, in general, in good agreement with realistic numerical examples. The grazing function is shown to scale linearly with FODO cell bend angle, but to be independent of FODO cell length. The ideal value is $g=0$ at the collimator, but finite nonzero values are acceptable. Practically achievable grazing functions are described and evaluated, for both amorphous and crystal primary collimators, at RHIC, the SPS (UA9), the Tevatron (T-980), and the LHC.},

We give an error analysis of the evaluation of the interpolating polynomial using these two forms.  The modified Lagrange formula is shown to be backward stable.  The barycentric formula has a less favourable error analysis, but is forward stable for any set of interpolating points with a small Lebesgue constant.  Therefore the barycentric formula can be significantly less accurate than the modified Lagrange formula only for a poor choice of interpolating points.  This analysis provides further weight to the argument of Berrut and Trefethen that barycentric Lagrange interpolation should be the polynomial interpolation method of choice.}}

The paradox is resolved in a simple example by demonstrating that there is a torque present.  The mass distribution in the gyroscope undergoes a relativistic distortion, and the center of mass is displaced away from the position of the accelerating force.  The resulting torque $\pmb{\tau}=d\mathbf{L}/dt$.  The model also shows the physical origins of spin-orbit coupling and of the ``oscillating term.''  A related calculation shows why a moving magnetic dipole has an \emph{electric} dipole moment.}}

Twist maps correspond to Hamiltonians for which the velocity is a monotonic function of the canonical momentum.  Twist maps have a Lagrangian variational formulation.  One-parameter families of twist maps typically exhibit the full range of possible dynamics-from simple or integrable motion to complex or chaotic motion.  One class of orbits, the minimizing orbits, can be found throughout this transition; the properties of the minimizing orbits are discussed in detail.  Among these orbits are the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits, which form a scaffold in the phase space and constrain the motion of the remaining orbits.  The theory of transport deals with the motion of ensembles of trajectories.  The variational principle provides an efficient technique for computing the flux escaping from regions bounded by partial barriers formed from minimizing orbits.  Unsolved problems in the theory of transport include the explanation for algebraic tails in correlation functions, and its extension to maps of more than two dimensions.}}

Splitting methods arise when a vector field can be split into a sum of two or more parts that are each simpler to integrate than the original (in a sense to be made precise).  One of the main applications of splitting methods is in geometric integration, that is, the integration of vector fields that possess a certain geometric property (\emph{e.g.}, being Hamiltonian, or divergence-free, or possessing a symmetry or first integral) that one wants to preserve.  We first survey the classification of geometric properties of dynamical systems, before considering the theory and applications of splitting in each case.  Once a splitting is constructed, the pieces are composed to form the integrator; we discuss the theory of such `composition methods' and summarize the best currently known methods.  Finally, we survey applications from celestial mechanics, quantum mechanics, accelerator physics, molecular dynamics, and fluid dynamics, and examples from dynamical systems, biology and reaction-diffusion systems.},

Here we use Jefimenko's form of Maxwell's equations, without such approximations, to calculate the exact wakefields due to this effect in multiple bends and drifts.  It has been shown before that the influence of a drift can propagate well into a subsequent bend.  We show, for reasonable parameters, that the influence of a previous bend can also propagate well into a subsequent bend, and that this is especially important at the beginning of a bend.  Shielding by conducting parallel plates is simulated using the image charge method.  We extend the formalism to situations with compressing and decompressing distributions, and conclude that simpler approximations to bunch compression usually overestimate the effect.  Additionally, an exact formula for the coherent power radiated by a Gaussian bunch is derived by considering the coherent synchrotron radiation spectrum, and is used to check the accuracy of wakefield calculations.},

We show that parasymplectic subvolumes (to be defined in the paper), which can be thought of as even-dimensional subvolumes that are initially parallel to $k$ of the symplectic planes, have a minimal obtainable $2k$-volume.  We define volume expansion factors along the flow, and also the projection factors one obtains by projecting the volumes onto various planes.  This structure can be computed by looking at various subdeterminants or Gram determinants of the state transition matrix.  We also relate these various subdeterminants to classical integral invariants, giving a practical analytical method for their computation.  We then indicate how this can be used to quantify probability expansions in asteroid or space debris tracking problems, with large uncertainty distributions along one of the symplectic planes.  We also show how local subvolume expansion leads to the local collapse of phase space along solution trajectories.  Despite this general tendency we will also compute a preferred, orthogonal, symplectic basis associated with any linear(ized) symplectomorphism that retains its orthogonality after being mapped to the final state.}}

	Abstract = {A detailed exposition on the origin and buildup of polarization in high-energy electron storage rings is presented.  Fundamental, but not clearly understood, theoretical results are rederived and clarified (Ya.S. Derbenev and A.M. Kondratenko, Zh.\ Eksp.\ Teor.\ Fiz.\ \textbf{64}, 1918 (1973) [Sov.\ Phys.---JETP \textbf{37}, 968 (1973)]).  It is explained how to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a storage ring, in particular the spin-dependent terms, to the first order in Planck's constant.  Relevant perturbations, their time scales, and the various ensemble averages, are elucidated: the use of statistical concepts is shown to be essential to the calculation.  Semiclassical techniques are used to derive, and extend to first order in $g-2$, the equilibrium degree of polarization (the Derbenev-Kondratenko formula).  In so doing, some aspects of the polarization mechanism not previously recognized are uncovered.  Because Derbenev and Kondratenko use a different mathematical approach, a proof is given of the equivalence between their formalism and the one used here.}}

	Abstract = {A new algorithm is presented to evaluate the equilibrium degree of polarization in a high-energy electron storage ring (the Derbenev-Kondratenko formula).  The algorithm includes all modes of orbital motion, to arbitrary orders in principle, thus facilitating the calculation of so-called ``spin resonances,'' especially higher-order resonances.  The algorithm is applicable to storage rings of arbitrary geometry and energy, and, in particular, is able to deal with overlapping resonances.  Precautions are described to ensure stability of the algorithm.  In the approximation of linear orbital dynamics, a computer program has been written to implement this algorithm, and sample results are presented.}}

	Abstract = {We claim there is a new class of spin trajectories in circular accelerators, which are not accounted for in current theories of spin dynamics.  We call them exceptional orbits.  On such orbits the \emph{spin} motion drives a secular growth of the \emph{orbital} amplitude(s).  Our results do not by themselves prove the spatial separation of spin states of a relativistic charged particle beam, but our findings are consistent with those of other workers.  Our findings \emph{do} invalidate the unconditional use of the semiclassical approximation to treat the orbital motion, to diagonalize the spin--orbit Hamiltonian.  We analyze a simple model in detail to demonstrate our ideas.  We review the canonical transformation theory of spin dynamics in storage rings, and extend it to account for exceptional orbits.  We also examine how exceptional orbits affect map-based algorithms.  We show that the algorithms can sometimes break down, in ways not hitherto suspected.  We show that on an exceptional orbit the secular rate of spin phase advance depends explicitly on the orbital arc-length, in contradiction to claims that the spin tune depends only on the orbital amplitudes.}}

We use recently discovered analytical solutions for the invariant spin field and spin tune in several storage ring models, to obtain a general overview of the spin dynamics and also of the polarization.  We calculate the long-term polarization and the depolarizing spin resonances for each model.  In particular, we present a detailed examination of the so-called ``Snake resonances''.  We also compare our analytical solutions against the results of numerical simulations.  We consider various measures of the degree of long-term polarization and point out fallacious tacit assumptions in the conventional literature.

High-precision tests of the Standard Model using spin-polarized beams are reviewed; also innovative studies using spin dynamics as a tool for accelerator physics \emph{per se}.  We include important historical works as well as modern developments in the field.  The fundamental theory is derived in detail, starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics, electrodynamics and statistical mechanics, as well as `accelerator physics'.

	Abstract = {In this paper, I study the feasibility of making a turn-by-turn spin measurement to extract the spin tune from a polarized beam injected perpendicular to the stable spin direction.  For the ideal case of a zero-emittance beam with no spin-tune spread, there would be no spin decoherence, and a measurement of the spin tune could easily be made by collecting turn-indexed polarization data over several million turns.  However, in a real beam there is a momentum spread which provides a spin-tune spread.  With a coasting beam the tune spread can cause decoherence of the spins resulting in a fast depolarization of the beam in as few as a thousand turns.  With synchrotron oscillations the decoherence time can be greatly increased, so that a measurement becomes feasible with summation of the turn-by-turn data from a reasonable number of bunches ($\lesssim 100$).  Three cases of $1$, $2$, and $2\frac{1}{2} Siberian snakes are considered.  By using spin tune measurements for both the single and double snake cases, we could vastly improve the calibration of the optimum settings for the RHIC snakes.}}

In order to maximize polarization in RHIC, we examined several options to improve the matching of the stable spin direction during beam transfer from the AGS to each of the RHIC rings.  While the matching is not perfect, the most economical method appears to be a lowering of the injection energy by one unit of $G\gamma$ from 46.5 to 45.5.}}

	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {In order to study the spin structure of the neutron at high energy, a beam rich in polarized neutrons needs to be developed.  The neutron has no charge and cannot be accelerated, so either deuterons or helions must be considered.  When it comes to spin manipulation and stability of the polarization in a circular accelerator, it is the anomalous part of the magnetic moment which is important.  If the anomaly is too small, then manipulation becomes difficult as in the case of deuterons---spin rotators and Siberian snakes become ineffective.  ${}^3\text{He}$ nuclei appear to be the easiest choice for a polarized neutron beam.  In this paper I discuss the prospects for both helions and deuterons as polarized beams in RHIC or in an electron-ion collider.}}

	Abstract = {The fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator is proposed as a muon accelerator because of its large aperture and no need of magnet ramping.  In particular, the nonscaling type of FFAG has been studied because of its simple magnets and its unique acceleration method using the path out of the rf bucket.  A recent 6D tracking study reveals, however, that the time of flight difference due to transverse amplitude causes the longitudinal emittance blowup which limits the transverse acceptance.  This is a serious problem for an accelerator that is expected to accelerate a muon beam with huge transverse emittance.  Two methods of curing the problem are examined by particle tracking.  One is higher rf voltage and the other is higher harmonic rf in addition to the fundamental one.  A 50\% increase of rf voltage suppresses the emittance blowup.  Second and third harmonic rf also improve the final momentum spread.  Both methods work fine in a single FFAG system.  However, a few percent of particle loss is inevitable when two FFAG are cascaded.},

	Abstract = {In a linear nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator, betatron tunes vary over a wide range and a beam has to cross integer and half-integer tunes several times.  Although it is plausible to say that integer and half-integer resonances are not harmful if the crossing speed is fast, no quantitative argument exists.  With tracking simulation, we studied orbit and optics distortion due to alignment and magnet errors.  It was found that the concept of integer and half-integer resonance crossing is irrelevant to explain beam behavior in a nonscaling FFAG when acceleration is fast and betatron tunes change quickly.  In a muon FFAG accelerator, it takes 17 turns for acceleration and the betatron tunes change more than 10, for example.  Instead, the orbit and optics distortion is excited by random dipole and quadrupole kicks.  The latter causes beam size growth because the beam starts tumbling in phase space, but not necessarily with emittance growth.},

In EMMA, some collective effects become a concern even though the beam stays in the ring for only 10 to 20 turns.

	Abstract = {Operation with natural chromaticity in a linear nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator causes crossing of the low order resonances such as integer and half-integer.  Although those resonances are not systematic ones, small errors, such as a typical misalignment of $10\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ rms, significantly increase particle amplitude when the accelerator is operated with a slow acceleration rate.  For example, there is practically no dynamic aperture if it takes 1000 turns to finish the whole acceleration cycle.  Chromaticity correction with sextupole and octupole reduces the maximum available dynamic aperture in a lattice without errors.  On the other hand, the accelerator becomes less sensitive to errors.  To use a nonscaling FFAG for applications where, unlike a muon accelerator, the large acceptance is not a high priority demand (such as a proton driver or a particle therapy accelerator), chromaticity correction seems to be an essential ingredient.},

The orbit excursion is about 5 times smaller than in a conventional scaling FFAG accelerator and the beam size growth due to typical errors is at most 10\%.},

A number of methods have been proposed for direct numerical integration of multiscale problems with special structure, such as the mollified impulse method (Garcia-Archilla, Sanz-Serna and Skeel 1999 \textit{SIAM J. Sci. Comput.} \textbf{20} 930--63) and the reversible averaging method (Leimkuhler and Reich 2001 \textit{J. Comput. Phys.} \textbf{171} 95--114).  Features of problems of interest, such as thermostatted coarse-grained molecular dynamics, require extension of the standard framework.  At the same time, in some applications the computation of averages plays a crucial role, but the available methods have deficiencies in this regard.  We demonstrate that a new approach based on the introduction of shadow variables, which mirror physical variables, has promised for broadening the usefulness of multiscale methods and enhancing accuracy of or simplifying computation of averages.  The shadow variables must be computed from an auxiliary equation.  While a geometric integrator in the extended space is possible, in practice we observe enhanced long-term energy behaviour only through use of a variant of the method which controls drift of the shadow variables using dissipation and sacrifices the formal geometric properties such as time-reversibility and volume preservation in the enlarged phase space, stabilizing the corresponding properties in the physical variables.  The method is applied to a gravitational three-body problem as well as a partially thermostatted model problem for a dilute gas of diatomic molecules.}}

The nodes of these quadratures are nearly uniformly distributed, and the number of nodes is only marginally more than the optimal $(N+1)^2/3$ nodes. Using these quadratures, we discretize the reproducing kernel on a rotationally invariant subspace to construct an analogue of Lagrange interpolation on the sphere. This representation uses function values at the quadrature nodes. In addition, the representation yields an expansion that uses a single function centred and mostly concentrated at nodes of the quadrature, thus providing a much better localization than spherical harmonic expansions. We show that this representation may be localized even further. We also describe two algorithms of complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ for using these grids and representations. Finally, we note that our approach is also applicable to other discrete rotation groups.},

	Abstract = {We study longitudinal fields of coherent synchrotron radiation in a perfectly conducting rectangular pipe. Our theory is based on the paraxial approximation of electromagnetic waves in the frequency domain. The longitudinal impedance of coherent radiation is obtained. By considering the pole structure of the impedance in a rectangular pipe, we have derived the analytical expression of the longitudinal field in the time domain. According to the analysis, we show how the sidewalls of the vacuum chamber affect the longitudinal field of coherent radiation. In addition, we discuss the limit of applicability of the paraxial approximation.},

The here presented material is intended to be a tutorial of the basic processes 
involved when polarized beams travel around circular accelerators and of the theory used to describe first order effects.  Much of this material has been presented in [G.H. Hoffstaetter.

This is not only impressive as a result, but also the methods which lead to this result are very interesting.

	Volume = {70},
	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {When polarized particles are accelerated in a synchrotron, the spin precession can be periodically driven by Fourier components of the electromagnetic fields through which the particles travel.  This leads to resonant perturbations when the spin-precession frequency is close to a linear combination of the orbital frequencies.  When such resonance conditions are crossed, partial depolarization or spin flip can occur.  The amount of polarization that survives after resonance crossing is a function of the resonance strength and the crossing speed.  This function is commonly called the Froissart-Stora formula.  It is very useful for predicting the amount of polarization after an acceleration cycle of a synchrotron or for computing the required speed of the acceleration cycle to maintain a required amount of polarization.  However, the resonance strength could, in general, only be computed for first-order resonances and for synchrotron sidebands.  When Siberian Snakes adjust the spin tune to be $\frac{1}{2}$, as is required for high-energy accelerators, first-order resonances do not appear and higher-order resonances become dominant.  Here we will introduce the strength of a higher-order spin-orbit resonance, and also present an efficient method of computing it.  Several tracking examples will show that the so computed resonance strength can indeed be used in the Froissart-Stora formula.  HERA-p is used for these examples which demonstrate that our results are very relevant for existing accelerators.}}

	Volume = {7},
	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {Accelerating polarized proton beams and storing them for many turns can lead to a loss of polarization when accelerating through energies where a spin rotation frequency is in resonance with orbit oscillation frequencies.  First-order resonance effects can be avoided by installing Siberian snakes in the ring, devices which rotate the spin by $180^\circ$ around the snake axis while not changing the beam's orbit significantly.  For large rings, several Siberian snakes are required.  Here a criterion will be derived that allows one to find an optimal choice for the orientation of the snake axes.  Rings with superperiod four are analyzed in detail, and the HERA proton ring is used as an example for approximate fourfold symmetry.  The proposed arrangement of Siberian snakes matches their effects so that all spin-orbit coupling integrals vanish at all energies and therefore there is no first-order spin-orbit coupling at all for this choice, which I call snake matching.  It will be shown that in general at least eight Siberian snakes are needed and that there are exactly four possibilities to arrange their axes.  When the betatron phase advance between snakes is chosen suitably, four Siberian snakes can be sufficient.  Since the spin motion depends on a particle's trajectory, protons at different phase space positions generally have different spin directions.  The time averaged polarization at each phase space point is parallel to the invariant spin field, and the spread of this spin field limits the polarization that can be stored.  By the here presented choice of Siberian snakes this limit is completely eliminated up to first order in the transverse phase space coordinates.  The invariant spin field and the amplitude-dependent spin tune are also computed without linearization to show the advantages of this choice of snakes.  Ultimately, the goal of snake matching is to reduce the loss of polarization during the acceleration of the beam.  To show that a favorable choice of snakes has been found, polarized protons are tracked for part of HERA-p's acceleration cycle which shows that polarization is preserved best for the here proposed arrangement of Siberian snakes.}}

	Abstract = {It has been predicted and found experimentally that the polarization direction of particles on the closed orbit of a circular accelerator can be manipulated, without a noticeable reduction of polarization, by means of a slow variation of magnetic fields.  This feature has been used to avoid imperfection resonances where the spin precession frequency is close to a multiple of the circulation frequency.  As a first step we show that this property is related to an adiabatic invariant of spin motion.  The proof is relatively simple since it involves only two frequencies, the spin-rotation frequency and the particle's rotation frequency on the closed orbit.  The invariant spin field (ISF) describes a periodic polarization state of a beam's phase-space distribution.  This ISF leads to a very useful parametrization of coupled spin and orbit dynamics.  We prove that this ISF gives rise to an adiabatic invariant of spin-orbit motion.  This proof is much more complicated since the orbital frequencies are involved.  Because of this adiabatic invariance, a beam's spin field follows slow changes of the accelerator's ISF that can occur during a slow acceleration cycle.  This feature is essential when high-order spin-orbit resonances are crossed, since it allows polarization that has been reduced at the resonance condition to be recovered, to a large degree, after the resonances have been crossed.}}

	Abstract = {This work is devoted to an examination of Stern-Gerlach forces consistent with special relativity and is motivated by recent interest in the relativistic Stern-Gerlach force acting on polarized protons in high-energy particle accelerators.  The equations for the orbital and spin motion of a classical charged particle with arbitrary intrinsic magnetic dipole moment in an external electromagnetic field are considered and by imposing the constraints of special relativity and restricting to first order in spin (= first order $\hbar$) a well-defined class of spin-orbit systems is obtained.  All these systems can be treated on an equal footing including such prominent cases as those considered by Frenkel and by Good.  The Frenkel case is considered in great detail because I show that this system is identical with the one introduced by Derbenev and Kondratenko for studying spin motion in accelerators.  In particular I prove that the spin-orbit system of Derbenev and Kondratenko is (nonmanifestly) Poincar\'e covariant and identify the transformation properties of this system under the Poincar\'e group.  The Derbenev-Kondratenko Hamiltonian was originally proposed as a way to combine relativistic spin precession and the Lorentz force.  The aforementioned findings now demonstrate that the Derbenev-Kondratenko Hamiltonian also provides a legitimate framework for handling the relativistic Stern-Gerlach force.  Numerical examples based on the Frenkel and Good cases for the HERA proton ring and electromagnetic traps are provided.}}

To achieve polarized proton beams in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC, 250 GeV), the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA, 820 GeV), and Fermilab's TeV accelerator (TEVATRON, 900 GeV), ideas and techniques applicable to accelerator physics are needed.  In this publication we will stress an important aspect of very high energy polarized proton beams, namely, the fact that the equilibrium polarization direction can vary substantially across the beam in the interaction region of a high energy experiment when no countermeasure is taken.  Such a divergence of the polarization direction would not only diminish the average polarization available to the particle physics experiment, but it would also make the polarization involved in each collision analyzed in a detector strongly dependent on the phase space position of the interacting particle.  In order to analyze and compensate for this effect, methods for computing the equilibrium polarization direction are needed.  In this paper we introduce the method of stroboscopic averaging, which computes this direction in a very efficient way.  Since only tracking data are needed, our method can be implemented easily in existing spin tracking programs.  Several examples demonstrate the importance of the spin divergence and the applicability of stroboscopic averaging.}}

To aid in avoiding the usual pitfalls in working with these problems, a review is made of several different approaches to the problem of an infinitesimally extended accelerating physical object.  The central problem is in taking successive Lorentz transformations between parallel coordinate systems and clearly distinguishing between physical rotations of the object and coordinate rotations.  When accounting for the energy associated with the Thomas precession a simple physical explanation is given rather than the misleading description popularly presented.}}

Spin motion coupled to the orbital dynamics is then defined, resulting in a class of spin-orbit motions which are important for storage rings.  Phase space densities and polarization fields are introduced.  It is important, in the context of storage rings, to understand the behavior of periodic polarization fields and phase space densities.  Due to the $2\pi$ time periodicity of the spin-orbit equations of motion the polarization field, taken at a sequence of increasing time values $\theta$, $\theta + 2\pi$, $\theta + 4\pi$, \dots, gives a sequence of polarization fields, called the stroboscopic sequence.  We show, by using the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, that under very general conditions the Ces\`aro averages of that sequence converge almost everywhere on phase space to a polarization field which is $2\pi$-periodic in time.  This fulfills the main aim of this paper in that it demonstrates that the tracking algorithm for stroboscopic averaging, encoded in the program SPRINT and used in the study of spin motion in storage rings, is mathematically well-founded.  The machinery developed is also shown to work for the stroboscopic average of phase space densities associated with the orbital dynamics.  This yields a large family of periodic phase space densities and, as an example, a quite detailed analysis of the so-called betatron motion in a storage ring is presented.},

	Abstract = {Symplectic maps (canonical transformations) are treated from the Lie algebraic point of view using Lie series and Lie algebraic techniques.  It is shown that under very general conditions an analytic symplectic map can be written as a product of Lie transformations.  Under certain conditions this product of Lie transformations can be combined to form a single Lie transformation by means of the Campbell--Baker--Hausdorff theorem.  This result leads to invariant functions and generalizes to several variables a classic result of Birkhoff for the case of two variables.  It also provides a new approach since the connection between symplectic maps, Lie algebras, invariant functions, and Birkhoff's work has not been previously recognized and exploited.  It is expected that the results obtained will be applicable to the normal form problem in Hamiltonian mechanics, the use of the Poincar{\'e} section map in stability analysis, and the behavior of magnetic field lines in a toroidal plasma device.}}

	Abstract = {A systematic algorithm is developed for performing canonical transformations on Hamiltonians which govern particle motion in magnetic mirror machines.  These transformations are performed in such a way that the new Hamiltonian has a particularly simple normal form.  From this form it is possible to compute analytic expressions for gyro and bounce frequencies.  In addition, it is possible to obtain arbitrarily high order terms in the adiabatic magnetic moment expansion.  The algorithm makes use of Lie series, is an extension of Birkhoff's normal form method, and has been explicitly implemented by a digital computer programmed to perform the required algebraic manipulations.  Application is made to particle motion in a magnetic dipole field and to a simple mirror system.  Bounce frequencies and locations of periodic orbits are obtained and compared with numerical computations.  Both mirror systems are shown to be insoluble, i.e., trajectories are not confined to analytic hypersurfaces, there is no analytic third integral of motion, and the adiabatic magnetic moment expansion is divergent.  It is expected also that the normal form procedure will prove useful in the study of island structure and separatrices associated with periodic orbits, and should facilitate studies of breakdown of adiabaticity and the onset of ``stochastic'' behavior.}}

In order to accumulate the spin-dependent beam transition radiation, a passive superconducting cavity is proposed.  The increase of effective voltage in the cavity (TM110 mode) with time, related to the free oscillating coherent spin of the beam, is calculated.

Siberian snakes can be used in order to provide a sufficiently small value for the spin tune spread.  Possible schemes of measurement of the accumulated voltage are presented.  The noise limitations are taken into account and evaluated.  There are in the RFP dynamics different effects of the beam charge---cavity interaction, positive and negative.  The negative effects are the beam noises, while the positive ones are as follows: (i) the possibility to enhance the spin-dependent beam cavity interaction, via the spin-orbit coupling in the machine focusing lattice; (ii) the possibility to increase, if necessary, the effective quality of the superconducting resonator, via redistribution of decrements between the TM110 mode and the beam coherent oscillation.  A scheme of elimination of charge effects from the measurement is proposed, if needed, which is based on use of two cavities with a spin rotator (Siberian snake) between them.  Finally, the RFP scheme is transformed to a Beam Spin Maser system, which is a spin feedback based on the superconducting cavities.  This would allow one to create, to observe, and to use for polarization measurements the phenomenon of beam spontaneous coherent spin flip.  Numerical examples are given.

A small value of deuteron magnetic anomaly (-0.13 comparatively to 1.8 for protons) makes the Siberian snakes method impractical for deuterons, but it leaves the possibility to undertake all the measures on fast and adiabatic crossing of individual spin resonances in a ring developed and implemented earlier and in recent years at ZGS and AGS for polarized proton beams.  Fast crossing methods are estimated effective for deuteron energy range below 100\,GeV (EPIC collider).  At higher energies (up to 250\,GeV for RHIC and 1\,TeV for HERA or Tevatron), beam excitation by the static or RF dipoles above the statistical level (due to imperfections or beam emittance) is estimated to be efficient.  Static dipoles also can be used in order to transform the vertical polarization of injected and accelerated beam to the stable longitudinal polarization, in energy areas near the spin-resonance value.  The possibilities of spin RF-flipping are also discussed, including a possibility of RF-trapped longitudinal spin at half-integer spin tune.  Finally, an exotic scheme of a twisted spin synchrotron is described with the possibility of stable longitudinal spin in the whole energy range of storage facility.},

\[
  n = -(r/B)\partial B/\partial r

varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if $n$ alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which $n$ is azimuthally constant and must lie between $0$ and $1$. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if $2\nu_x$ or $2\nu_z$ or $\nu_x + \nu_z$ is integral, where $\nu_x$ and $\nu_z$ are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution.

The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a ``transition energy'' $E_1 \approx \nu_x Mc^2$ the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {The solution of many physical evolution equations can be expressed as an exponential of two or more operators acting on initial data.  Accurate solutions can be systematically derived by decomposing the exponential in a product form.  For time-reversible equations, such as the Hamilton or the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, it is immaterial whether or not the decomposition coefficients are positive.  In fact, most symplectic algorithms for solving classical dynamics contain some negative coefficients.  For time-irreversible systems, such as the Fokker-Planck equation or the quantum statistical propagator, only positive-coefficient decompositions, which respect the time-irreversibility of the diffusion kernel, can yield practical algorithms.  These positive time steps only, forward decompositions, are a highly effective class of factorization algorithms.  This work presents a framework for understanding the structure of these algorithms.  By a suitable representation of the factorization coefficients, we show that specific error terms and order conditions can be solved \emph{analytically}.  Using this framework, we can go beyond the Sheng-Suzuki theorem and derive a lower bound for the error coefficient $e_{VTV}$.  By generalizing the framework perturbatively, we can further prove that it is not possible to have a sixth-order forward algorithm by including only the commutator $[VTV]\equiv[V,[T,V]]$.  The pattern of these higher-order forward algorithms is that in going from the $(2n)$th to the $(2n+2)$th order, one must include a different commutator $[VT^{2n-1}V]$ in the decomposition process.}}

	Abstract = {Symplectic integrators evolve dynamical systems according to modified Hamiltonians whose error terms are also well-defined Hamiltonians.  The error of the algorithm is the sum of each error Hamiltonian's perturbation on the exact solution.  When symplectic integrators are applied to the Kepler problem, these error terms cause the orbit to precess.  In this work, by developing a general method of computing the perihelion advance via the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector even for nonseparable Hamiltonians, I show that the precession error in symplectic integrators can be computed analytically.  It is found that at leading order, each paired error Hamiltonians cause the orbit to precess oppositely by exactly the same amount after each period.  Hence, symplectic corrector, or process integrators, which have equal coefficients for these paired error terms, will have their precession errors cancel at that order after each period.  With the use of correctable algorithms, both the energy and precession error are of effective order n+2 where n is the nominal order of the algorithm.  Thus the physics of symplectic integrators determines the optimal algorithm for integrating long-time periodic motions.}}

	Abstract = {The exponential splitting of the classical evolution operator yields symplectic integrators if the canonical Hamiltonian is separable.  Similar splitting of the noncanonical evolution operator for a charged particle in a magnetic field produces exact energy-conserving algorithms.  The latter algorithms evaluate the magnetic field directly with no need of a vector potential and are more stable with far less phase errors than symplectic integrators.  For a combined electric and magnetic field, these algorithms from splitting the noncanonical evolution operator are neither fully symplectic nor exactly energy conserving, yet they behave exactly like symplectic algorithms in having qualitatively correct trajectories and bounded periodic energy errors.  This work shows that exponential-splitting algorithms of any order for solving particle trajectories in a general electric and magnetic field can be systematically derived by use of the angular momentum operator of quantum mechanics.  The use of operator analysis in this work fully comprehends the intertwining interaction between electric and magnetic forces and makes possible the derivation of highly nontrivial integrators.}}

	Title = {Relativistic Motion in a Constant Electromagnetic Field},
	Volume = {50},
	Year = {2009},
	Abstract = {For a relativistic charged particle moving in a constant electromagnetic field, its velocity 4-vector has been well studied.  However, despite the fact that both the electromagnetic field and the equations of motion are purely real, the resulting 4-velocity is seemingly due to a complex electromagnetic field.  This work shows that this is not due to some complex formalism used (such as Clifford algebra) but is intrinsically due to the fact that the $o(3,1)$ Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is equivalent to two commuting complex $su(2)$ algebras.  Expressing the complex $su(2)$ generators in terms of the boost and rotation operators then naturally introduces a complex electromagnetic field.  This work solves the equation of motion not as a matrix equation, but as an operator evolution equation in terms of the generators of the Lorentz group.  The factorization of the real evolution operator into two commuting complex evolution operators then directly gives the time evolution of the velocity 4-vector without any reference to an intermediate field.}}

	Abstract = {A matrix formalism is developed to describe the spin dynamics in a synchrotron near a single depolarization resonance as the particle energy (and therefore its spin precession frequency) is varied in a prescribed pattern as a function of time such as during acceleration.  This formalism is first applied to the case of crossing the resonance with a constant crossing speed and a finite total step size, and then applied also to other more involved cases when the single resonance is crossed repeatedly in a prescribed manner consisting of linear ramping segments or sudden jumps.  How repeated crossings produce an interference behavior is discussed using the results obtained.  For a polarized beam with finite energy spread, a spin echo experiment is suggested to explore this interference effect.}}

	Title = {Spin echo in synchrotrons},
	Volume = {10},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {As a polarized beam is accelerated through a depolarization resonance, its polarization is reduced by a well-defined calculable reduction factor.  When the beam subsequently crosses a second resonance, the final beam polarization is considered to be reduced by the product of the two reduction factors corresponding to the two crossings, each calculated independently of the other.  This is a good approximation when the spread of spin precession frequency $\Delta\nu_\text{spin}$ of the beam (particularly due to its energy spread) is sufficiently large that the spin precession phases of individual particles smear out completely during the time $\tau$ between the two crossings.  This approximate picture, however, ignores two spin dynamics effects: an interference-overlap effect and a spin echo effect.  This paper is to address these two effects.  The interference-overlap effect occurs when $\Delta\nu_\text{spin}$ is too small, or when $\tau$ is too short, to complete the smearing process.  In this case, the two resonance crossings overlap each other, and the final polarization exhibits constructive or destructive interference patterns depending on the exact value of $\tau$.  Typically, the beam's energy spread is large and this interference-overlap effect does not occur.  To study this effect, therefore, it is necessary to reduce the beam energy spread and to consider two resonance crossings very close to each other.  The other mechanism, also due to the interplay between two resonance crossings, is spin echo. It turns out that even when the precession phases appear to be completely smeared between the two crossings, there will still be a sudden and short-lived echo signal of beam polarization at a time $\tau$ after the second crossing; the magnitude of which can be as large as 57\%.  This echo signal exists even when the beam has a sizable energy spread and when $\tau$ is very large, and could be a sensitive (albeit challenging) way to experimentally test the intricate spin dynamics in a synchrotron.  After giving an analysis of the interference-overlap and the echo effects, two possible experiments to explore them are suggested.}}

As typical examples of the method, two special cases are discussed: a plane electron beam and a cylindrical electron beam with longitudinal magnetic field.  In both cases it is found that the space-charge density of the beam is entirely controlled by the magnetic field and that the maximum current is obtained for a suitable optimum magnetic field.}}

	Abstract = {We consider adaptive geometric integrators for the numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems with greatly varying time scales.  A time regularization is considered using either the Sundman or the Poincar{\'e} transformation.  In the latter case, this gives a new Hamiltonian which is usually separable, but with one of the parts not always exactly solvable.  This system can be numerically integrated with a splitting scheme where each part can be computed using a symplectic implicit or explicit method, preserving the qualitative properties of the exact solution.  In this case, a backward error analysis for the numerical integration is presented.  For a one-dimensional near singular problem, this analysis reveals a strong dependence of the performance of the method with the choice of the monitor function $g$, which is also observed when using other symmetric nonsymplectic integrators.  We also show how this dependence greatly increases with the order of the numerical integrator used.  The optimal choice corresponds to the function $g$, which nearly preserves the scaling invariance of the system.  Numerical examples supporting this result are presented.  In some cases a canonical transformation can also be considered, making the system more regular or easy to compute, and this is also illustrated with some examples.},

Based on the formal solution obtained from the Magnus series expansion, we show how to modify a standard splitting method for autonomous problems to treat non-autonomous systems with similar or better efficiency.

It is shown that $p(x)$ carries essentially all the information needed to construct processed splitting methods for numerically approximating the evolution of linear systems.

	Abstract = {HERA is the high energy electron(positron)-proton collider at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg.  Following eight years of successful running, five of which were with a longitudinally spin polarized electron(positron) beam for the HERMES experiment, the rings have now been modified to increase the luminosity by a factor of about five and spin rotators have been installed for the H1 and ZEUS experiments.  The modifications involve nonstandard configurations of overlapping magnetic fields and other aspects which have profound implications for the polarization.  This thesis addresses the problem of calculating the polarization in the upgraded machine and the measures needed to maintain the polarization.  A central topic is the construction of realistic spin-orbit transfer maps for regions of overlapping fields and their implementation in existing software.  This is the first time that calculations with such fields have been possible.  Using the upgraded software, calculations are presented for the polarization that can be expected in the upgraded machine.  It is concluded that about 50 \% polarization should be possible.  The key issues for tuning the machine are discussed.  The last chapter deals with a separate topic, namely how to exploit a simple unitary model of spin motion to describe electron depolarization and thereby expose a misconception appearing in the literature.},

	Abstract = {In the following report we present a collection of notes on spin dynamics in storage rings.  The spin motion is described in terms of a pair of real canonical spin variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and in four different spin dreibeins.  The orbital motion is described by using the canonical variables $x$, $p_x$, $z$, $p_z$, $\sigma = s - v_0 \cdot t$, $p_\sigma = (1/\beta_0^2) \cdot \eta$ with $\eta = \Delta E/E_0$ of the fully $6$-dimensional canonical formalism.  Action-angle variables $J_k$, $\Phi_k$ of the linear coupled orbital motion are introduced by a canonical transformation.  The equations thus obtained are valid for arbitrary velocity of the particle (below and above transition energy).  The general periodic solution for spin motion, the $\vec{n}$-axis, is determined by the method of forced solution.  Action-angle variables of spin motion and a dreibein which is a single valued function of the particle coordinates $(J_k, \Phi_k, s)$ on an arbitrary particle path are defined and the spin tune as a function of $J_k$ is calculated.  Finally, classical spin diffusion caused by radiation processes is investigated and a derivation of the depolarisation time presented.}}

	Volume = {7},
	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {We present an in-depth analysis of the concept of spin precession frequency for integrable orbital motion in storage rings.  Spin motion on the periodic closed orbit of a storage ring can be analyzed in terms of the Floquet theorem for equations of motion with periodic parameters, and a spin precession frequency emerges in a Floquet exponent as an additional frequency of the system.  To define a spin precession frequency on nonperiodic synchrobetatron orbits we exploit the important concept of quasiperiodicity.  This allows a generalization of the Floquet theorem so that a spin precession frequency can be defined in this case, too.  This frequency appears in a Floquet-like exponent as an additional frequency in the system in analogy with the case of motion on the closed orbit.  These circumstances lead naturally to the definition of the uniform precession rate and a definition of spin tune.  A spin tune is a uniform precession rate obtained when certain conditions are fulfilled.  Having defined spin tune we define spin-orbit resonance on synchrobetatron orbits and examine its consequences.  We give conditions for the existence of uniform precession rates and spin tunes (e.g., where small divisors are controlled by applying a Diophantine condition) and illustrate the various aspects of our description with several examples.  The formalism also suggests the use of spectral analysis to ``measure'' spin tune during computer simulations of spin motion on synchrobetatron orbits.},

	Abstract = {In a circular machine, where the linear lattice functions $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and a phase advance can be defined, one expects the fringe field effects to be negligible if the change in these functions is small through the element.  However, this may not always be the case.  In such situations, it is useful to have a leading order result which is adapted to tracking and analytical analysis.  In this paper, we provide such a result for the quadrupole and we also provide a general formula for the effect of an arbitrary rectilinear multipole.

Starting from the standard multipole expansion for the $B$ field of a $2(n+1)$-pole $(n\geq 1)$, we compute the missing terms in the vector potential expansion consistent with the pure $2(n+1)$-pole symmetry.  We then compute the leading effects of the fringing fields of a multipole on the dynamics.  Finally, we apply this result to quadrupoles and reproduce the original results of Lee-Whiting, Matsuda, and Wollnik.

For the quadrupole, we show how to write a symplectic (canonical) integrator for the dynamics which can be used in a standard circular machine kick code.  For higher order multipoles, we display the implicit characteristic function solution as first proposed by Dragt.},

Moser or Deprit-like normalizations are done directly on the maps, thereby avoiding the complex time-dependent theory.  Linear and nonlinear Floquet variables are redefined entirely in terms of maps.  This approach relies heavily on the Lie representation of maps introduced by Dragt and Finn [J.\ Math.\ Phys.\ \textbf{20}, 2649 (1979); J.\ Geophys.\ Res.\ \textbf{81}, 13 (1976)].  One might say that although the Hamiltonian is not used in the normalization transformation, Lie operators are used, which are themselves, in some sense, pseudo-Hamiltonians for the maps they represent.  The techniques find application in accelerator dynamics or in any field where the Hamiltonian is periodic, but hopelessly complex, such as magnetic field design in stellarators.},

The extra complexity is handled by algebraic manipulations connecting the Lie representation of the usual Euclidean group with its dynamical equivalent.  This is achieved by eliminating potential divergences in the ``thin block'' representation.  Although this representation is ideally suited for large machines, it fails in the neighborhood of $180^\circ$ racetrack magnets due to these divergences.

We present a method which uses the trajectory of the deterministic process as basis functions for quasiarbitrary distributions.  A map for the stochastic process can then be computed.  This may have applications in electron storage rings or other devices perturbed by a small stochasticity.  In this paper we will look only at the most elementary applications of the method.}}

So I reconstructed the relevant history of geometrical integration in accelerator physics as much as I could by talking to collaborators and using my own understanding of the field.  The reader should not be too surprised if this account is somewhere between history, science and perhaps even fiction.},

	Title = {Random Reflexions on my Work on Spin and {PTC} inspired by {D}esmond {B}arber},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {I am trying to put the BMT equation in the library PTC.  This is rather easy conceptually.  At the same time, in DESY, Dr.~Barber in the manner of a story teller, presented me with an interesting narrative about spin in accelerator physics.  This is important for me because PTC has in it FPP.  That is to say certain tools are expected by the user of PTC.  Therefore I owe it to Barber and others to provide a coherent picture within PTC that includes spin.  This means that the library FPP should have some spin tools which allow one to track ``spin lattice functions'' (whatever that means) around the ring.  This is also important for me as it provides me anchors on which to tie down my own understanding.  Others who think similarly (Bengtsson for example) might find the present expos\'e valuable.  So in my parlance theory means a normal form.

So in this private note I write down the ideas that flashed through my brain since my DESY visit.  This paper is purely a polaroid picture of my brain at this instant in time.  There is no claim of novelty and thus this is not publishable in any form.

I discuss the Invariant Spin Field, the Floquet representation, the single resonance model (I do not know what it means in standard literature so please excuse the usage here) and also the adiabatic invariant and the associated Hannay angle.

I did not discuss the spin fluctuation.  This is trivial with beam envelopes.  I intend to rewrite PTC anyway as far as fluctuations and radiation are concerned.

As I said, this paper is an attempt to establish anchor points and let others know about them since they will use my tools.}}
